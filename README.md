# Optimal Path Finder

This project uses Ant Colony Optimization to find the optimal path between a set of waypoints in 3D space.

## Features

- Reads waypoint data from a JSON file
- Calculates distances between waypoints considering altitude
- Uses Ant Colony Optimization to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem
- Visualizes the optimal path on a 2D plot

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Geopy
